	<p class="mainFont">Phase 0<br>
Introduction
	From October 16 to October 28, 1962, a 13 day crisis was the determining factor to whether humanity would be a victim to once again, another war. The Cuban Missile Crisis was a time of vigilance and understanding. We consider it one of the major lessons learnt during the cold war. Would disagreeing sides fight at the expense of many innocent lives? One mishap, and perhaps someone could obliviously send missiles resulting in a misunderstood war. 
<br><br>
Phase 1<br>
Background
<br>
After the horrific WWII, the U.S. and Soviet Union were on tense grounds. These led to conflicts resulting in the name, The Cold War. In the midst of it, the U.S. plotted against Cuba to overthrow the government and their leader, Fidel Castro. The U.S. didn’t approve of their communist government, and they decided to act upon it. For Cuba's relations with Nikita Khrushchev also kept the U.S. on edge. The U.S. then proceeded to invade Cuba not acknowledging that they were quite capable of defending themselves. Their failed attempt at overthrowing them was later titled, The Bay of Pigs. After, Cuba was rather rattled at their sudden aggression, so they sought assistance and defense from the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was compliant with their needs, and so they proceeded to get to business. Unknown to the U.S. the Soviet Union was able to ship about 700 missiles to Cuba until a U.S. stealth plane caught sight of what they’ve been dealing with. A bit after President Kennedy was told the news, he decided they would approach the situation carefully. On October 16, 1962, the Cuban Missile Crisis had officially commenced.
<br><br>
Phase 2<br>
Approach<br>
<br>
	With the U.S. panicked, President Kennedy made a wise decision to diffuse the timidity. During the panic, many people wanted to launch an airstrike and invasion on Cuba. Not many people acknowledged the fact that this could start another World War. Thankfully, and with the assistance of his advisors, President Kennedy decided they would block all missile shipments towards Cuba with a ring of ships. He also decided for the already shipped missiles to be removed and that the sites be destroyed. Reassuringly, the missiles were quite unreliable and For extra precaution, he avoided the term “blockade,” for it was a term used if war was present. Instead, he labeled it a “quarantine.” 
<br><br>
Phase 3<br>
Letters<br>
<br>
For the USSR, this would break their deal with Cuba, and Nikita would have to send President Kennedy an infuriated letter regarding it. It contained him stating that President Kennedy’s actions are considered an act of aggression, and how further action could lead to the brink of war. President Kennedy later replied to his passive aggressive letter stating that it’s not a blockade, and instead, a quarantine. He also requested that the USSR would withdraw their missiles, but the USSR defended their actions by saying that the shipments were only for Cuba’s defense.  This left the two sides at an intense stalemate, each side not willing to give up their position on Cuba.
<br><br>
Phase 4<br>
Miscommunication<br>
<br>
	President Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev’s letters weren't the only thing that could’ve brought the two countries to war. On October 27, 1962, a spy plane was shot down by a Soviet missile overseeing it. Not even a day later, a nuclear armed Soviet submarine was accidentally hit by a depth charge, trying to signal it to come up to the surface. The sub was too far underwater to communicate with the surface and had thought war had started. They prepared to launch a torpedo, a nuclear one. Before they could, a unanimous decision between the captain, political officer, and second IA, must all agree to launch. The captain and political officer authorized it, but the second IA, Vasili, denied the launch. This bold move saved the day and possibly prevented the war.
<br><br>
Phase 5<br>
Relief<br>

	Though it seemed like this concluded the ongoing tension, America entered DEFCON 2 for the first time, and it seemed things got more cautious from there. Every soldier was ready for a nuclear attack. With hundreds of missiles on each side, ready to be launched at a moment's notice, it seemed like war would break out any second. However, diplomacy did not die here. A secret meeting occurred in D.C. between Robert Kennedy and Anatoly Dobrynin, both important political figures of their respective countries. They negotiated, each creating a proposal until they became more even out and fair. Eventually they decided on their proposal. For America, they’d remove their missiles from Italy and Turkey, and promise to never attack Cuba. In return, the USSR would take out their missiles from Cuba. After the meeting occurred, Anatoly contancted Mother Russia saying, “Time is of the essence and we shouldn’t miss the chance.” Luckily, they got through, and at 9:AM the next day, Cuba was cleared of USSR missiles. While most citizens were happy knowing that the possible death looming over them was gone, some were outraged for “bargaining with the enemy.” Eventually, future historians applaud Kennedy and Nikita’s ability to work together diplomatically instead of taking the semi-easy, semi-hard way out and just simply heading off to nuclear war. 
<br><br>
Phase 6<br>
Closing<br>

	However this sits on a sour note, this was a wake up call, not a false alarm. The fact that the war was a single officer away from millions of deaths shows just how fragile relationships and communications can be between two sides compared to what they are controlling behind the scenes of what they are talking about. This moment in history really teaches us how communication and our actions can build our future consequences.

	<h1>The Cuban Missile Crisis</h1>
	<br>
	<p class="tabMain">Imagine waking up, going through your everyday routine, knowing that you, and everyone else around you, could be wiped off the face of the earth, at the push of a button. This was the sad truth for many people during the time after WWII, known as The Cuban Missile Crisis. At first, it was just the USA and USSR facing off, both having missiles that could easily wipe the other one out and they knew this. However, it spiraled out of control and put the entire world at stake. Those missiles were never so close to launching than during the 13 day period known as the Cuban Missile Crisis, possibly the closest the earth ever got to self-destruction via nuclear missile war</p>
	<br>
	<p class="tabMain">So, how did we get here? After WWII there was a 45 year period known as the Cold War. During this Cold War, the US tried to make a move on Cuba and invade it. as they were taken over by revolutionary leader Fidel Castro during WWII,the attack otherwise known as the Bay of Pigs. Unfortunately, Cuba managed to defend itself so the US failed their attack. While they were trying to make another plan to invade them once more, a panicked Cuba sought help from the USSR, America’s main opponent  in the war. At the time the USSR was in a bit of trouble with the U.S as they had managed to get missiles into their short-trip neighbors Italy and Turkey. So when . By the time a US Stealth Plane went to survey Cuba, what they saw was horrifying. 36 R-Cuba asked more missiles to get rid of the U.S, who were closeby, the USSR was more than happy to place them. Soon enough supplies arrived at the bays of Cuba, and they worked away. By the time a U.S stealth plane looked over Cuba, the missiles were built, pointed straight at America. News quickly got to Kennedy, and he held a meeting with his other political figures. Everyone wanted to launch an airstrike and invasion on Cuba, but Kennedy knew that this would push the world into war, so he chose a more peaceful option. Kennedy chose to issue an order to block all shipments to Cuba that weren’t supplied for food, water, or medicine. This may not have seemed like a big deal, but this didn’t exactly look good in the USSR’s future. If the supplies couldn’t be shipped out to Cuba, they couldn’t keep the missiles up, which would make it easier for the US to raid it again. In a letter from Khruschev, he furiously wrote to Kennedy, saying that “ The Violation of Freedom to use International Waters and International Airspace is an act of aggression, which pushes mankind towards the abyss of World Nuclear War. “ </p>
	<br>
	<p class="tabMain">Not wanting to go to war, Kennedy sent a letter of his own, implying that the blockade was not a blockade at all, charading it as only a quarantine, for it was not blocking basic necessities, which from the way it seemed could classify as a quarantine. Along with the letter, he requested that Cuba withdraw all missiles from the USSR, but both the USSR and Cuba said they were only defensive, in place after the Bay of Pigs Invasion, which was fair enough. The US and USSR were at a stalemate, neither willing to give up their position to Cuba, both knowing the other one would certainly take their chance with it."</p>
	<br>
	<p class="tabMain">Things almost went to hell on October 27th, 1962, when a spy plane was shot down by a Soviet missile that was overseeing it. Not even a day later, a nuclear armed Soviet submarine was accidentally hit by a depth charge, trying to signal it to come up to the surface. The sub was too far under water to communicate with the surface, thought war had started, and prepared to launch a torpedo, a nuclear one. Before they could, a unanimous decision between the Captain, Political Officer, and Second IA, must all agree to launch. The Captain and PO authorized it, but Second IA, Vasili, denied the launch. This bold move saved the day and possibly the war.</p>
<br>
	<p class="tabMain">Unfortunately this didn’t end it, America entered DEFCON 2 for the first time in history, every single soldier ready for a nuclear attack. With hundreds of missiles on each side, ready to be launched at a moment's notice, it seemed like war would break out any second. However, diplomacy did not die here.</p>
<br>
	<p class="tabMain">A secret meeting occurred in D.C between Robert Kennedy and Anatoly Dobrynin, both important political figures of their respective countries. They negotiated, each creating a proposal until they became more even out and fair. Eventually theory found one. For America, they’d remove their missiles from Italy and Turkey, and promise to never attack Cuba. In return, the USSR would take out their missiles from Cuba.<br>After the meeting occurred, Anatoly contancted mother Russia, saying “ Time is of the essence and we shouldn’t miss the chance.“</p>
